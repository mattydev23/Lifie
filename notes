Todo
- If two cells touching they mate not duplicate
- Two cells cannot be on top of each other? --Actually maybe that makes sense!!
- System to mate/kill each other
- Random colors: http://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically/
- Create chance for abnormalities?
- Create algorith for random numbers based on probability: http://excel.bigresource.com/Track/excel-n04kwXhV/


Ideas
- Death: time / no resources
- Mating: How do I make it not too random. (color mixer: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colormixer.asp)

Trait Ideas
 - Agressive / Passive (run away)
 - Home body / Wanderer
 - Mater (might have more chance of being bigger/hardier/live longer?) / Self producer (easier to come by / dont last as long)
 - Big (requires more food but better fighter?) / small (requires less food but worse fighter?)
